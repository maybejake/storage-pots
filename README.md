### Storage Pots add a new vanilla-friendly storage method that can be used to store large quantities of items! A single storage pot can store a single type of item, up to 16384 items! (256 stacks)

Items can be added to and removed from storage pots in many ways!
- Right clicking on a pot with an item will place it inside
- Throwing items onto a pot will add them in bulk!
- Right clicking on a pot with an empty hand will pop one item out of the top
- Shift-right clicking on a pot with an empty hand will pop a whole stack out instead!

Want to know exactly how much is in your pot? Craft a Whispering Sherd and shift-right click on a pot! It'll whisper to you, telling you the contents of the pot...
